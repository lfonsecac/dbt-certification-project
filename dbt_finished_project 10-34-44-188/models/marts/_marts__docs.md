|   10   | Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change.                       |
|    9   | Excellent game. Always want to play it.                                                   |
|    8   | Very good game. I like to play. Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game. |
|    7   | Good game, usually willing to play.                                                       |
|    6   | Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood.     |

|    4   | Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.                   |
|    3   | Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad.                            |
|    2   | Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again.                                      |
|    1   | Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this.                       |
